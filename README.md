# ðŸš€ AI-Powered React.js â†” Next.js Converter: Call for Contributions! ðŸŒŸ

## **About the Project**
Weâ€™re building an **AI model** to seamlessly convert entire React.js projects to Next.js and vice versa. This tool will help developers migrate projects between these popular frameworks, saving countless hours of manual work. To achieve this, we need **real-world examples of paired projects** to train our model.

Your contributions can make this groundbreaking project a reality!

## **How to Contribute**

1. **Prepare Your Projects**:
   - Select a React.js project and its equivalent Next.js version (or create one if you donâ€™t have any).
   - Ensure both projects follow best practices and demonstrate typical use cases such as routing, API handling, server-side rendering, and styling.

2. **Folder Structure**:
   - Create a folder with the following structure:
     ```
     contributions/
       â”œâ”€â”€ <your-github-username>/
           â”œâ”€â”€ react-project/
               â”œâ”€â”€ src/
               â”œâ”€â”€ public/
               â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
               â””â”€â”€ README.md
           â”œâ”€â”€ nextjs-project/
               â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
               â”œâ”€â”€ public/
               â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
               â””â”€â”€ README.md
           â””â”€â”€ README.md
     ```
   - Each project should include a `README.md` file explaining:
     - Key features.
     - Instructions to run the project.
     - Any specific details about the differences between the two versions.

3. **Submit Your Contribution**:
   - Fork this repository.
   - Add your contribution folder under the `contributions/` directory.
   - Submit a pull request (PR) to this repository.

## **Submission Guidelines**
To ensure consistency and usefulness, please follow these guidelines:
1. **File Requirements**:
   - Both the React.js and Next.js projects should be fully functional.
   - Include all necessary files (e.g., `package.json`, `src`, `pages`, `public`).
   - Ensure projects are clean, with no sensitive information (e.g., API keys).

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Follow best practices for React.js and Next.js development.
   - Use modern ES6+ syntax and clean code principles.
   - Ensure proper folder structure and modularity.

3. **Features to Include**:
   - **React.js Project**:
     - Client-side routing using `react-router-dom`.
     - Components and hooks usage (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.).
     - API integration with `fetch` or `axios`.
   - **Next.js Project**:
     - File-based routing in `pages/`.
     - Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) using `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`.
     - API routes in `pages/api/`.

4. **README.md File**:
   - For each project, include a detailed `README.md` with:
     - Project overview and features.
     - Prerequisites and dependencies.
     - Steps to run the project locally.

## **Evaluation Criteria**
Submissions will be evaluated based on:
1. **Completeness**: Are both the React.js and Next.js versions functional and well-documented?
2. **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, maintainable, and aligned with best practices?
3. **Complexity**: Does the project include diverse and challenging use cases (e.g., SSR, SSG, dynamic routing)?
4. **Originality**: Is the submission unique and useful for training purposes?

## **FAQs**

### 1. Do I need to create both projects from scratch?
Not necessarily. You can submit existing projects if you have both React.js and Next.js versions. Just make sure theyâ€™re complete and functional.

### 2. What happens to my submitted projects?
Your projects will be used solely for training our AI model. We will not redistribute or sell your code.

### 3. Can I contribute more than one pair of projects?
Absolutely! You can submit as many paired projects as you like, provided they meet the guidelines.
